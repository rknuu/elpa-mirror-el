* Create a local repository mirror using Emacs!
Emacs is a fantastic development platform and it has a pletora of
tools availible through the brilliant [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][ELPA]] provider.

This script provides a way to mirror these resources.

** Why?
While most will not have any issues with accessing ELPA, there may be
scenarios where you need to be behind a firewall, or you need to cache
the packages you use to help build a more repeatible environment.

** Known Limitations
- Only the last mirrored binaries are availible for download.
